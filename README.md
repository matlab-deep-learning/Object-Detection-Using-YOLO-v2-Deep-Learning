# Object Detection Example using Yolo v2 Deep Learning

This demo shows the full deep learning workflow for an example using image data in [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html). In it we use deep learning based object detection using Yolo v2 to identify vehicles of interest in a scene.

We show examples on how to perform the following parts of the Deep Learning workflow:

- Part1 - Data Preparation
- Part2 - Modeling
- Part3 - Deployment

For more details, please refer to the documentation article [Getting Started with YOLO v2.](https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ug/getting-started-with-yolo-v2.html)

This demo is implemented as a MATLAB project and will require you to open the project to run it. The project will manage all paths and shortcuts you need. There is also a significant data copy required the first time you run the project.

## Part 1 - Data Preparation

This example shows how to automate ground truth labeling.

To run:
1. Open MATLAB project YOLOv2ObjectDetection.prj
2. Open and run Part01_DataPreparation.mlx

## Part 2 - Modeling

This example shows how to train a you only look once (YOLO) v2 object detector.

To run:
1. Open MATLAB project YOLOv2ObjectDetection.prj
2. Open and run Part02_Modeling.mlx

## Part 3 - Deployment

This example shows how to generate CUDA® MEX for a you only look once (YOLO) v2 object detector. 

To run:
1. Open MATLAB project YOLOv2ObjectDetection.prj
2. Open and run Part03_Deployment.mlx
